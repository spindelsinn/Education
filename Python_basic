# input and open file
input Get data from the “outside world”. This might be reading data from a ﬁle, or even some kind of sensor like a microphone or GPS. In our initial programs, our input will come from the user typing data on the keyboard.
output Display the results of the program on a screen or store them in a ﬁle or perhaps write them to a device like a speaker to play music or speak text.
name = input('Enter file:') 

handle = open(name, 'r') 

type(x) - what type a value has  

 //  % - modulus operator

 x is not y # x is not the same as y

int(), float(), str()

import random
