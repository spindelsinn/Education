COUNT() is a built in database function that retrieves the number of rows that match the query criteria. 
To get the total number of rows in a given table, simply issue:
>>select COUNT(*) from tablename

How many rows with  Canada in table
>>select COUNT(COUNTRY) from MEDALS where COUNTRY='CANADA'

DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set. To retrieve unique values in a column issue:
>>select DISTINCT columnname from tablename

Example: to know which countries get gold medals, without repeated answers when they have more than one. 
>>select DISTINCT COUNTRY from MEDALS where MEDALTYPE = 'GOLD'

LIMIT is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database. To retrieve just the first 10 rows in a table:
>>select * from tablename LIMIT 10

EXAMPLE:

-- 0. Drop table INSTRUCTOR in case it already exists
drop table INSTRUCTOR
;
--1. Create table INSTRUCTOR
CREATE TABLE INSTRUCTOR
  (ins_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, 
   lastname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, 
   firstname VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL, 
   city VARCHAR(15), 
   country CHAR(2)
  )
;
--2A. Insert single row for Rav Ahuja
INSERT INTO INSTRUCTOR
  (ins_id, lastname, firstname, city, country)
  VALUES 
  (1, 'Ahuja', 'Rav', 'Toronto', 'CA')
;
--2B. Insert the two rows for Raul and Hima
INSERT INTO INSTRUCTOR
  VALUES
  (2, 'Chong', 'Raul', 'Toronto', 'CA'),
  (3, 'Vasudevan', 'Hima', 'Chicago', 'US')
;
--3. Select all rows in the table
SELECT * FROM INSTRUCTOR
;
--3b. Select firstname, lastname and country where city is Toronto
SELECT firstname, lastname, country from INSTRUCTOR where city='Toronto'
;
--4. Change the city for Rav to Markham
UPDATE INSTRUCTOR SET city='Markham' where ins_id=1
;
--5. Delete the row for Raul Chong
DELETE FROM INSTRUCTOR where ins_id=2
;
--5b. Retrieve all rows from the table
SELECT * FROM INSTRUCTOR 
;

select all firstnames start with R.
>>SELECT firstname FROM author where firstname like R%

SELECT title, pages FROM book WHERE pages >=290 AND pages <=300
or
SELECT title, pages FROM book WHERE pages between 290 and 300

SELECT firstname, lastname FROM author WHERE country='AU' OR country='BR' 
or
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM author WHERE country IN('AU','BR')
