COUNT() is a built in database function that retrieves the number of rows that match the query criteria. 
To get the total number of rows in a given table, simply issue:
>>select COUNT(*) from tablename

How many rows with  Canada in table
>>select COUNT(COUNTRY) from MEDALS where COUNTRY='CANADA'

DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set. To retrieve unique values in a column issue:
>>select DISTINCT columnname from tablename

Example: to know which countries get gold medals, without repeated answers when they have more than one. 
>>select DISTINCT COUNTRY from MEDALS where MEDALTYPE = 'GOLD'

LIMIT is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the database. To retrieve just the first 10 rows in a table:
>>select * from tablename LIMIT 10
